# Tankmod: Revived, a vehicle and content mod for Cataclysm DDA and BN

The official replacement to my old Tanks And Other Vehicles mod, for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead and Cataclysm: Bright Nights. Formerly Dependent upon Vehicle Additions Pack, formerly an in-repo mod and now being maintained as a third-party mod with no need for dependency upon other mods.

This version is for the 0.1 Stable release of Cataclysm: Bright Nights. To use this, copy over the Tankmod_Revived_BN folder into data/mods.

If you are using experimental Bright Nights, it is recommended you update from the main page using the "download zip" option within the green "code" button, and copy the Tankmod_Revived_BN folder into data/mods folder.

Likewise, if you are using experimental DDA, use the Tankmod_Revived folder from the master branch.

Notable changes from the last in-repo version of Tankmod:
1. The main battle tank, self-propelled howitzer, and infantry fighting vehicle have been overhauled, more closely modeled after their real-world counterparts (which they've now been named after). Gone are the odd, spacious Merkava-like layouts, in favor of designs that better mimic the M1 Abrams, M109 howitzer, and M2 Bradley.
2. The light tank and mobile gun system have been removed for now. One was based off a design that hasn't been in active service for ages and would have a wildly different armament, while the second will need some serious overhauling and a different ammotype. I have plans to re-add them, however!
3. Weapons and ammunition have been rebalanced heavily. Damage and explosive force more closely matches available information concerning the tank, artillery, and autocannon ammunition they're based off of. Handloads in particular are more resource-intensive but have the sort of raw impact that makes them worth it, and undesired ammunition can be taken apart for the relevant resources.
4. 30mm autocannon and ammunition have been swapped out for 25mm, as the IFV's real-world influence uses a different model of autocannon. 30mm might return separately for a different vehicle and/or helicopter use, but more likely future updates will see increased use of 25mm.
5. Since tank drones are obsolete in vanilla and shifted to Aftershock, this mod introduces a rare variant of tank drone meant to fill that missing niche.
6. Rebalanced and updated vehicle groups. Tanks and such should generally only spawn in vehicle groups where other military vehicles can be found, and generally have more sensible weights.
7. The atomic mini-tank and its accompanying 120m autoloading gun have been re-added as a solar-electric design, and its vehicle name makes it clear this is a fictional design, in contrast to most of the other additions based off real-world vehicles.
8. Occasional spawns of an alternative main battle tank based off the M60 Patton, implied to have been brought out of storage and hastily rearmed to supplement existing forces. You also have a decent chance of finding some that weren't yet fully kitted out.

Planned future features:
1. Reimplementing the light tank, most likely to be based off the M551 Sheridan and thus will likely use 152mm TOW instead of a tank cannon, or possibly a design based on the revived M8 that are evidently re-entering military trials.
2. Possibly the revival of the mobile gun system as the 105mm Stryker variant.
3. A 155mm towed howitzer might show up as well, likely in dedicated spawn locations implying hastily set up positions, the same use case that 105mm howitzers will see.
4. Naval and aircraft use of 25mm. Patrol boats might become a rare spawn at docks, some crashed aircraft might have the 25mm autocannon, etc.
